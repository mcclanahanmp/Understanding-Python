   <h2>What is Python?</h2>
   <p>
   Python is one of many programming languages that is powerful, yet easy to learn. Python supports multiple 
   programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming. It first appeared 
   in 1991, with now over 30 years of improvements. Its primary filename extension is .py and current release is 
   3.11.1 which was released within December of 2022. So, what can you do with Python? Well, Python can be used 
   to the height of your imagination, to solve problems or even build robots. You can build websites with Python, 
   conduct data analysis and even create new software. There are a wide variety of libraries and frameworks 
   associated with Python that can assist in machine learning, language processsing and other areas of data 
   science.

   <p4 style="font-size: large;">Consider the table below and imagine millions of data points instead of the few that you see here. 
      Large companies like SpaceX pull in billions of data from satellites and telescopes that capture 
      information about space in digital format. Going through these data points manually can become 
      exhausting. But what if you could write a couple lines of code creating a program that could do 
      that for you. What would have taken weeks or months to review can now take a few minutes or even 
      seconds.
